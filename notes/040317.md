## Static Chains & Closures

## Block Structure and Static Chains

> Block-structured programming languages in the tradition of Algol present special problems for language implementors. For nested functions, how is the storage for their free variables to be found on the stack? The earliest Algol compilers used a **static chain** field in the activation record. The static chain can be set by the compiler to link to the activation record of the nearest activation record of the lexically containing function. For example, using OCaml-ish syntax, the nested function ```h``` contains a free occurrence of ```x``` — a variable bound in the lexically containing block for ```f```. Note that the stack might be populated by many activation records, e.g, those for ```g``` below. 

```
let rec f x =
  let rec h m = m + x in
  and g n = 
    if n == 0 then
      (h 4)
    else
      (g (n - 1))
  in
  if x == 2 then
    (g x)
  else
    (f (x - 1))
in
f 3
```

```
+---+---------------+
| f |               |
+---+  static chain +  - link to activation record containing storage for free variables of f.
    | dynamic chain +  - link to activation record of function that produced this activation of f.

```

## Closures	

Most modern programming languages feature both block-structure (nested binding forms) and binding forms such as functions or classes that can be returned as values. For example, in Java, classes can be nested and the objects created from those classes can escape their scope. In this case, the language implementation has to support the lookup of the value of a free variable who's containing binding form could not be found on the dynamic call stack. Instead, the storage has to be allocated in the **heap** in a closure data structure. For example, using OCaml-style syntax, note that when ```f``` is called, the value of ```a``` has to be found.

```
let a = 2 in
let f x = x + a
in
f 3
```

could be closure-converted by the compiler to: 

```
let a = 2 in
let f = {code = \r. r.arg + r.env.a;
         env = {a = a}}
in
f.code {arg = 3; env = f.env}
```

Note that the three records ```{code = …; env = …}```, ```{a = ...}```  and ```{arg = …; env = …}``` are all allocated in the heap so this is a relatively expensive operation.
