#### 1. Sets, Relations & Maps

**The Idea**

- Computer software is often required to keep track of "collections" of things.

- Mathematicians have thought carefully about these collections, and know them as sets.

- Software is also often required to keep track of the association between items from one set (the "keys") and another (the "values").


**Basic Sets**

- A set is a collection of items with no duplicates.

  Examples:
        A = {1, 2, 3}
        B = {Bob, Alice, Joe}
        N = {0, 1, 2, ...}  natural numbers



- NB: Only restriction on elements is identity.


**Notation**

- alpha $\alpha$, beta $\beta$, gamma $\gamma$, Gamma $\Gamma$, delta $\delta$, epsilon $\epsilon$, tau $\tau$, sigma $\sigma$.
- A, B, C, …, X, Y, Z for sets;
- $\emptyset$ or {} for the empty set;
- a, b, c, ... for elements of sets;
- $a \in A$  means that $a$ is an element of set $A$;
- $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ is an n-tuple.

**Variables and Quantifiers**
- x, y, z  for variables (which *vary* over sets!)

- $\forall x \in A$ . *statement*

   asserts that *statement* holds for every element of A. For example, $\forall x\in\{1, 2, 3\}.x < 4$ means $1 < 4$ and $2 < 4$ and $3 < 4$. The occurrence of $x$ adjacent to the quanitifer is called a **binding occurrence** of $x$; the occurrence of $x$ to the right of the dot is called an **applied occurrence** or **use** of $x$. Note that we obtained $1 < 4$ by **plugging in** (or **substituting**) $1$ for $x$ in the statement $x < 4$.

- $\exists x \in A$ . *statement*

   asserts that *statement* holds for some element of A.


**Set Comprehensions**

- { x | *statement* } means set of all x such that *statement* holds;

  Example

  Evens = $\{ x \in \mathbb N \mid \exists y \in \mathbb N \mathrm{\ such\ that\ } x = 2y \}$

  or equivalently

  Evens = $\{ x \mid x \in \mathbb N \mathrm{\ and\ } \exists y \in \mathbb N \mathrm{\ such\ that\ } x = 2y \}$ 

**Basic Sets**

- Notation:
  - Subset : $A \subseteq B$ means $\forall x \in A . x \in B$;
  - Set Equality : $A = B$ means $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.


**Operations on Sets**

- Union : $A_1 \cup \ldots \cup A_n = \{ a \mid a \in A_i\ \mathrm{for\ some}\ i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}\}$;

- Intersection : $A_1 \cap\ldots\cap A_n = \{ a \mid a \in A_i \mathrm{\ for\ every\ } i\in\{1, \ldots, n\}\}$;

- Disjoint Union : $A_1 + \ldots + A_n = \{ (i, a) \mid a \in A_i\mathrm{\ for\ some\ } i\in\{1,\ldots, n\} \}$;

- Product : $A_1 \times \ldots\times A_n = \{ (a_1,\ldots, a_n) \mid a_i \in A_i\}$;

- Sequences : Let $A$ be a set and let $\epsilon$ denote the empty sequence.

   $A^* = \{ w \mid w = \epsilon \mathrm{\ or\ } w = aw' \mathrm{\ with\ } a \in A \mathrm{\ and\ } w' \in A^*\}$

  Example: $\{a, b\}^* = \{\epsilon, a\epsilon, b\epsilon, aa\epsilon, ab\epsilon, \ldots \}$

  Notes:

  - This is an example of an inductive definition,
  - Trailing $\epsilon$s are usually omitted so the set in the example above is written $\{\epsilon, a, b, aa, ab, \ldots \}$.

- Powerset : Let $A$ be a set. Then the powerset of $A$ is 

  $P(A) = \{ A' \mid A' \subseteq A\}$

  Example : P({1,2}) = {{}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}};


  Diversion: *Russell's Paradox*

- Let $\mathbf R = \{ A \mid A \not\in A\}$.  The set of all non-self-containing sets. E.g., $\{a\} \in \mathbf R$. Is $\mathbf R\in \mathbf R$?

- Assume that $\mathbf R \not\in \mathbf R$. Then $\mathbf R \in \mathbf R$.

    - Assume that $\mathbf R \in \mathbf R$. Then $\mathbf R \not\in \mathbf R$.

    - So $\mathbf R \in \mathbf R \mathrm{\ iff\ } \mathbf R \not\in \mathbf R$. Naive set theory is inconsistent. 

**Relations**

- $R$ is a(n n-ary) relation on sets $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ if $R \subseteq A_1 \times \ldots \times A_n$.

- When $R$ is an n-ary relation on sets $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ and $A_1 = \ldots = A_n$ we say that $R$ is an n-ary relation on $A_1$;

- When R is a finite set we say it is a finite relation.


**Binary Relations**

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets and let $R$ be a relation on $A, B$.

**Domain of Definition**:  DomDef(R) = $\{ a \in A \mid \mathrm{for\ some\ } b\in B,  (a, b) \in R\}$


**Example Relations**

A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {Bob, Alice}

- R1 = A x B = {(1, Bob), (1, Alice), (2, Bob), (2, Alice), (3, Bob), (3, Alice)}

- R2 = {}

- R3 = {(1, Bob), (3, Alice)}              // e.g., DomDef(R3) = {1, 3}

- R4 = {(1, Alice), (2, Alice), (3, Alice)}


**Partial Maps** (aka **Partial Functions**)

Let $R$ be a binary relation on $A$, $B$. $R$ is a partial map from $A$ to $B$ if and only iff 

$$\forall a\in A. b, b'\in B.\mathrm{if\ }(a, b)\in R \mathrm{\ and\ } (a, b') \in R \mathrm{\ then\ } b = b'.$$

R1 is not a partial map but all of R2, R3 and R4 are partial maps.

**Notation**:

- We usually use f, g, h, ... for partial maps;
- We use the notation $f(a)$ to denote the unique $b$ such that $(a, b)\in f$. Note that this notation isn't defined if there is no $b$ such that $(a, b)\in f$.

**Total Map**

Let $f$ be a partial map from A to B. Then $f$ is a **total map** from A to B iff DomDef(f) = A. In the examples above, only R4 is a total map from A to B.

**Function Set Constructors**

- The set of all partial maps from A to B:  A -o-> B = { f | f is a partial map from A to B }

- The set of all total maps from A to B:  A --> B = { f | f is a total map from A to B }



**Examples**

      {1, 2} --> {Bob, Alice} = { {(1, Bob), (2, Bob)}, 
                                  {(1, Alice), (2, Alice)},
                                  {(1, Bob), (2, Alice)}, 
                                  {(1, Alice), (2, Bob)}
                                }
      {1, 2} -o-> {Bob, Alice} = {1, 2} --> {Bob , Alice}           
                                 U 
                                 { {},
                                   {(1, Bob)}, 
                                   {(1, Alice)},
                                   {(2, Bob)}, 
                                   {(2, Alice)}
                                 }


**Predicates**

- Let Bool = {true, false};

  = {void} + {void} = {(void, 0), (void, 1)}

- P is a predicate on A if P is a map from A to Bool.

- Example: >2 is a unary predicate on N:

  >2 = {(0, false), (1, false), (2, false), (3, true), ...}


Implementing Maps

  Finite maps (from A --> B, or A -o-> B) implemented with a data structure such as hash table, e.g., Java's HashMap.

- The set of "keys" in A must be identifiable (see equivalence below)

- Other efficient data structures can be used if A is totally ordered

### 2. Order###

**Preorder**

- Let $R$ be a relation on $A$. $R$ is **reflexive** iff $\forall x \in A . (x, x) \in R$;

- Let $R$ be a relation on $A$. $R$ is **transitive** iff $\forall x, y, z \in A. \mathrm{\ If\ } (x,y) \in R \mathrm{\ and\ } (y,z) \in R \mathrm{\ then\ } (x,z) \in R$.

- A relation that is both reflexive and transitive is called a **preorder**.


**Partial Orders**

- Let $R$ be a binary relation on $A$. $R$ is **symmetric** iff $\forall x, y \in A . \mathrm{\ if\ } (x, y) \in R \mathrm{\ then\ } (y, x) \in R$;

- Let $R$ be as above. $R$ is **antisymmetric** iff $\forall x, y \in A. \mathrm{\ if\ } (x, y) \in R \mathrm{\ and\ } (y, x) \in R \mathrm{\ then\ } x = y$.

- A symmetric preorder is called an **equivalence relation**.

- An antisymmetric preorder is called a **partial order**.


**Partially Ordered Sets**

If R is a reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive binary relation on A, we say that

- R is a partial order on set A
- The set A is partially ordered by R
- A is a partially ordered set (not mentioning R)
- A is a poset

Notation

- If set $A$ is partially ordered by $R$, we write $(A, R)$ or more often $(A, \le_R)$ or $(A, \le)$ if R is implied by context;

- For $a, a' \in A$, instead of writing $(a, a') \in R$ we usually write $a\le_R a'$ or $a\le a'$ if R is implied.

- If $a \le a'$ and $a != a'$ we write $a < a'$.


Examples

  A = {Bob, Alice},
    R1 = {(Bob, Bob), (Alice, Alice), (Bob, Alice)}

  **Hasse Diagram** of a Relation

        Alice
          |
         Bob


Examples

    A = P({Bob, Alice, Joe}) = { {}, 
                                 {Bob}, {Alice}, {Joe},
                                 {Bob, Alice}, {Bob, Joe}, {Alice, Joe},
                                 {Bob, Alice, Joe}
                               }

R2 = $(A, \subseteq)$ = {({}, {}), ({}, {Bob}), ({}, {Bob, Alice}), ...}

```
                               {Bob, Alice, Joe}
                               /      |        \
                    {Bob, Alice}  {Bob, Joe}   {Alice, Joe}
                          |     /\           /\     |
                        {Bob}      {Alice}       {Joe}
                                \     |       /
                                     {}
```

**Total Order**

- Let R be a partial order on A.  R is a total order on A iff $\forall x, y \in A . \mathrm{\ either\ } (x, y) \in R \mathrm{\ or\ } (y, x) \in R$.

- Example : $(\bf N, \le)$.


**Lexicographic Ordering**

Let $A$ be a set and let $\le_A$ be a partial order on $A$. We derive a partial order $\le_{A^*}$  on $A^*$ the sequences of elements from $A$.

$w \le_{A^*} w'$ iff either $w = \epsilon$ or $w = av$, $w' = a'v'$ and either $a \lt_A a'$ or  $a =_A a'$ and $v \le_{A^*} v'$.                                    

Example: 

Let A = {p, q}. Then A* = {e, p, q, pq, ppq, … } and $pq \le_{A^*} ppq$ because $a = p$, $v = q$, $a' = p$, $v' = pq$, $a = a'$ and $v \le_{A^*} v'$ because $a = q$, $v = \epsilon$, $a' = p$, $v' = q$ and $v \le_{A^*} v'$ because $v = \epsilon$.

Note: If $\le$ is a partial order, then so is $\le_{A^*}$.

**Summary**

In summary: we have type constructors: union, intersection, sum, product, sequence, -o-> and —>. Of these, sum, product, sequence, -o-> have direct computational interpretations.
